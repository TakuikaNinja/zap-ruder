  ; There are two ways to wait for vertical blanking: spinning on
  ; bit 7 of PPUSTATUS (as seen above) and waiting for the NMI
  ; handler to run.  Before the PPU has stabilized, you want to use
  ; the PPUSTATUS method because NMI might not be reliable.  But
  ; afterward, you want to use the NMI method because if you read
  ; PPUSTATUS at the exact moment that the bit turns on, it'll flip
  ; from off to on to off faster than the CPU can see.

  ; Now the PPU has stabilized, we're still in vblank.  Copy the
  ; palette right now because if you load a palette during forced
  ; blank (not vblank), it'll be visible as a rainbow streak.

  ; Set up game variables, as if it were the start of a new level.
